# TODO:


Make distance and direction work.

Implement database for storage, supporting SQL queries. Done.

Don't display a stop if there are no services arriving there.

Dynamically size the page based on number of trips, instead of statically. Done. 

Add a direction of nearest bus stop, as well as distance.

Create database of realtime GTFS which only updates from the web periodically, not every time it is queried. 
Update the arrival times from realtime database.
