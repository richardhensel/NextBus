# NextBus SEQ

Displays the next bus services departing from bus stops closest to you.


# TODO:

Implement database for storage, supporting SQL queries

Don't display a stop if there are no services arriving there.

Dynamically size the page based on number of trips, instead of statically. Done. 

Add a direction of nearest bus stop, as well as distance.
